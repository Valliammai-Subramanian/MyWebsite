## Course 2 Project: User Input

We are to build a coffee ordering app. This app includes the number of coffees ordered by the customers and the toppings or flavours for the order with button controls. The price will be calculated accordingly and the order summary will be generated to the customer with name(given as input) once the order is placed to the shop keeper.The shop keeper is the administrator and the customers are the users and there is no database(back-end) for storage. This app will place the live coffee orders to the shop in accordance with the input given by the customers. 


## Course 4 Project: Networking

We are to build a flight scheduling app. This app includes the departure and the arrival informations of all the flights with gate number for passengers and belt number for passenger's baggages. On building this app, we have undergone the use of threads to do time consuming tasks so that we made the app's user interface more fast and responsive. The networking is mainly entertained with HTTP requests and responses and connection establishment.
