## Review

### Info
This resource is being prepared by myself. I believe this resource accompanying notes/textbook is good to gain a basic knowledge and clear understanding of Java for the beginners.

### Repository
The [repository](https://github.com/Valliammai-Subramanian/Java) consists of the following: 
* Lectures - Notes
* Reference Books - Textbooks
