## Review

### Course Link
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775">GitHub-Caroline Buckey-Sarah Spikes </a>

### Info

This course on use of Github and Git is much of about version control for code. The course is well articulated in Coursera. The class has 3 weeks of lectures which translates the theory learnt to solving real-life problems.

### About the Course 
Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved. This course, built with input from GitHub, will introduce the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.

### Syllabus

<ul>
<li>Navigating a Commit History</li>
<li>Creating and Modifying a Repository</li>
<li>Using GitHub to Collaborate</li>
</ul>
