Adaickalavan received B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2010 and 2014, respectively. His Ph.D. was in Statistical Signal Processing which focused on novel adaptive learning algorithms and applied to the field of Optical Communication receiver design <a class="smallLink" href="projects.html#phd"></a>. His Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Kam Pooi Yuen](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elekampy/) and [Prof. Kim Hoon](https://sites.google.com/site/hoonkimlabs/people). 

From 2014 to 2017, he was a Machine Learning R&D Engineer at NXP Semiconductors Singapore, where he (i) lead the Type-B NFC ASK/PSK baseband receiver design and (ii) was engaged in object recognition tasks using convolutional neural networks for self driving car application. Since 2017, he has been a Machine Learning R&D Engineer with Panasonic Singapore, working on intelligent driver state modeling and prediction. 

His research interest includes machine learning, deep learning, artifical intelligence, and digital signal processing. He has worked on machine learning problems in the fields of object tracking, pattern classification, image recognition, and real-time-series data. Strong in mathematical modelling, stochastic processes, optimization theory, algorithm development, and bench-top experimental skills. 

Dr. Adaickalavan is a member of [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers - IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html). He is an ad-hoc reviewer for (i) [Optics Express - Optical Society of America](http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/), (ii) [Photonics Technology Letters - IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=68), and (iii) [Electronic Letters - IET](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/el).
